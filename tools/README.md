# Project Relatio — Tools (RRI)

Implementation tooling that operates *on* the Project Relatio vault. This is
**RRI** (reference-implementation) tooling, not architecture (RKA): it enforces
the standards, it does not define them.

Requires: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (PyYAML).

## graph_integrity.py — relationship-graph integrity (OPS-0002 automation)

Automates the OPS-0002 (Relationship Integrity & Graph Maintenance) check so the
Knowledge Architect no longer validates the graph by hand.

```
python graph_integrity.py
```

Reports, and writes `output/graph_integrity_report.md`:
- **Dangling references** — any `parent_documents` / `related_documents` entry that
  resolves to no existing object. Exit code 1 if any exist (reliability-critical).
- **One-directional KB links** — advisory; among Knowledge Base objects
  (INV/CLM/SRC/ENT/FND), an `A -> B` related link with no `B -> A` back
  (a parent-link counts as reciprocation). OPS-0002 §5 treats these as low-severity.

Matches the vault's actual convention: identifiers embedded in `title`/filename,
graph in `related_documents:` / `parent_documents:`.

## validate.py — structural conformance

```
python validate.py
```

Checks, per STD-0001/STD-0002:
- **Empty files** and **YAML validity** (frontmatter parses to a mapping).
- **Title-embedded identifier** — for identified objects (CON/KOS/STD/ROLE/TPL/OPS/
  ADR/ENT/SRC/INV/CLM/FND), the filename carries a valid identifier, the `title:`
  field carries the **same** one, and the identifier is **unique** across the vault.
  Identifier form: `TYPE-NNNN` (e.g. `KOS-0004`) or `ADR-CAT-NNNN` (e.g. `ADR-GOV-0001`).
- **Duplicate filenames** (advisory warning).

Exit code 1 if any errors. It does **not** check the `related_documents` graph — that
is graph_integrity.py's job. (Rebuilt from the old `id`/`[[wikilink]]` checks per
Backlog GB-2026-016; those predated the adopted standards.)
